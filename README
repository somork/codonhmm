These are the files of the codonhmm project.

The project is based on using the probabilistic logic programming language and machine learning system PRISM to implement and test a number of different HMM based models of protein coding potential to be used for e.g. gene finding.

Running these experiments requires PRISM that is available for download at:
http://sato-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/prism/

The project include the following directories: (See README within each directory for a more detailed description)

vecocyc: files for and from codonhmm experiments on the complete E. coli verified ecocyc dataset

e_5xcv: files for and from codonhmm E . coli cross-validation experiments with standard models

e_3x5xcv: files for and from codonhmm E . coli cross-validation experiments with 3-state version models

e_adph_5xcv: files for and from codonhmm E . coli cross-
validation experiments with ADPH version models

b_5xcv: files for and from codonhmm Bacillus cross-validation experiments with standard models

b_3x5xcv: files for and from codonhmm Bacillus cross-validation experiments with 3-state version models

b_adph_5xcv: files for and from codonhmm Bacillus cross-validation experiments with ADPH version models

Also included are:

codonhmm_s.tar.gz: a generic package for running codonhmm experimenets with standard models
codonhmm_3.tar.gz: a generic package for running codonhmm experimenets with 3-state model versions
codonhmm_a.tar.gz:a generic package for running codonhmm experimenets ADPH model versions
